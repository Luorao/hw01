## Bio

I am a second-year MACRM student from Harris School. My goal is to improve my coding skills. I mainly worked in **STATA** in the past and had done some **R**. (By the way, most people I know write code when they do **STATA**. So I was pretty surprised to see the *GUI* side of it.)

My research interests are in applied Economics so skills in data science become a must for me. I will use this course to:
* Advance my coding skills in **R**
* Possibly get to know some machine learning technique? 
* Meet people with similar interests!

## How did I change repo?
1. pull from the homework repo, and clone it using *SSH* link, you can find it on the right green button on  [hw01](https://github.com/Luorao/hw01). I use this instead of the *https* after setting up the SSH Key.

2. Few commands we need to make changes:
+ git add
+ git commit -m "comment"
+ git push

3. Then we can check and compare by using *git status* *git diff* etc ...
